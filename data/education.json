I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with Tyler and came to know him as a truly valuable asset to our team. Tyler quickly took on lead roles and was respected by myself and coworkers for his commitment to each task. His creativeness was always welcome in ways to better programs. When given an assignement/task there was never doubt that Tyler would not give it his all and exceeded expectations. Myself, staff and members were all fortunate to work with Tyler."
